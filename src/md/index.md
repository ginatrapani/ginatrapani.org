# Gina Trapani

Developer &middot; Writer &middot; Founder

## Hello!

    <img src={headshot} alt="Gina Trapani" />
]I'm Gina Trapani. I build apps and web sites, and I like
to write about the intersection of life and technology.

At work, I'm a Partner and Director of Engineering at
[Postlight](https://postlight.com), a digital
product studio in New York City. Before Postlight, I founded
sites and services like Makerbase, an IMDb for digital
projects (acquired by Fog Creek), and
[ThinkUp](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/technology/personaltech/thinkup-helps-the-social-network-user-see-the-online-self.html?_r=0), a social media analytics tool.

I'm probably best known for being the founding editor of
[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) (acquired by
Univision), and the author of the
[Lifehacker book](http://lifehackerbook.com). I
also created [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com), an
open source collection of text-based task list apps, and
[Narrow the Gapp](http://narrowthegapp.com), a
web site about the gender pay gap. I'm
[@ginatrapani](http://twitter.com/ginatrapani") on
Twitter, one of <i>The New York Times</i>' [Nine to Follow Among Millions](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/weekinreview/03carr-sidebar.html?ref=weekinreview)".

Here's [my formal, complete bio](bio.html). Some
nice strangers also wrote [a Wikipedia page about me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Trapani). To get in touch, you can send me an email to my usual
username at Gmail or [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/ginatrapani).

Thanks for stopping by.
