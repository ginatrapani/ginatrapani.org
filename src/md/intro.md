## Hello!

I'm [@ginatrapani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginatrapani/). I build software and companies. Sometimes I write about digital technology, and the ways it changes how people and organizations get things done.

Throughout my career I've started, led, and sold companies, sites, and services like Postlight (acquired by NTT DATA), [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) (acquired by Univision and later, Ziff Davis), and [ThinkUp](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/technology/personaltech/thinkup-helps-the-social-network-user-see-the-online-self.html?_r=0). Currently I am board chair at [Radiant Earth](https://radiant.earth/), a progressive technology non-profit focused on improving access to data about our world.

My writing has been published in a variety of outlets, including _The Harvard Business Review_, _The New York Times_, _Women's Health_, _Popular Science_, and _Macworld_. Profiles of my work have appeared in venues ranging from _The Wall Street Journal_ to _The New York Times_. Once upon a time, I authored three editions of the Lifehacker book.

A long time ago, _Fast Company_ named me one of the Most Influential Women in Technology, and _Wired_ magazine awarded me its prestigious Rave Award. Some nice strangers wrote [a Wikipedia page about me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Trapani).

To get in touch, you can send me an email to my usual username at Gmail. Thanks for stopping by.
