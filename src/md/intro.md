## Hello!

I'm Gina Trapani. I build software, teams, and products for fun and profit. I also like to write about the intersection of work and life and technology.

Currently I'm a Partner and Director of Engineering at [Postlight](https://postlight.com), where I help build apps, web sites, and platforms for our clients. Before Postlight, I founded sites and services like [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) (acquired by Univision), Makerbase (acquired by Fog Creek), and [ThinkUp](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/technology/personaltech/thinkup-helps-the-social-network-user-see-the-online-self.html?_r=0). My side projects include [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org), an open source collection of text-based task list apps, and [Narrow the Gapp](http://narrowthegapp.com), a web site about the gender pay gap.

My writing has been published in _The Harvard Business Review_, _The New York Times_, _Wired_, _CNN.com_, _PC World_, _Fast Company_, _Maximum PC_, and _Macworld_ magazines. Profiles of my work have appeared in venues ranging from _The Wall Street Journal_ to _The New York Times_. _Fast Company_ named me one of the Most Influential Women in Technology in 2009 and 2010, and _Wired_ magazine awarded me its prestigious Rave Award in 2006.

Some nice strangers also wrote [a Wikipedia page about me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Trapani). To get in touch, you can send me an email to my usual username at Gmail or [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/ginatrapani).

Thanks for stopping by.
