## Hello!

I'm [@ginatrapani](https://twitter.com/ginatrapani). I've been building software and companies for over two decades. I also like to write about technology, and the ways it changes how people and businesses get things done.

Currently I'm the CEO at [Postlight](https://postlight.com), a digital strategy, design, and software engineering firm in New York City. Postlight builds enterprise-scale web platforms and digital experiences for some of the world's biggest and best organizations. Need help building something? [Get in touch](https://postlight.com/).

Before Postlight, I founded sites and services like [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com) (acquired by Univision), Makerbase (acquired by Fog Creek), and [ThinkUp](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/technology/personaltech/thinkup-helps-the-social-network-user-see-the-online-self.html?_r=0). My side projects include [Todo.txt](https://todotxt.org), an open source collection of text-based task list apps, and [Narrow the Gap](https://narrowthegap.co), a web site about the gender pay gap.

My writing has been published in _The Harvard Business Review_, _The New York Times_, and _Wired_, among others. Profiles of my work have appeared in venues ranging from _The Wall Street Journal_ to _The New York Times_. Once upon a time, I authored three editions of the Lifehacker book. _Fast Company_ named me one of the Most Influential Women in Technology, and _Wired_ magazine awarded me its prestigious Rave Award.

Some nice strangers wrote [a Wikipedia page about me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Trapani). To get in touch, you can send me an email to my usual username at Gmail or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/ginatrapani).

Thanks for stopping by.
