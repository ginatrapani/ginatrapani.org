These days I spend almost all of my time working with my clients and team at [Postlight](https://postlight.com). If inspiration strikes during a rare pocket of free time, I'll publish a side project on [GitHub](https://github.com/ginatrapani) or a [Medium piece](https://ginatrapani.medium.com/). Here's what I've been up to lately.

On each pay gap page, I added a comparison of where we are as of 2020 and where things were in 2011.
