# [Gina Trapani](/)

## Welcome! I make small curiosities on the web for the joy of it.

I believe the web is the greatest creative platform of all time. I try to make things that are interesting, beautiful, and easy to use. Here are a few things I've made for fun.

Questions, notes, and bug reports are all welcome. You can send me a message on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ginatrapani.org), or via email to my usual username at Gmail.

Thanks for your interest.
