# [Gina Trapani](/)

## Hello! I'm a software person who loves to make stuff.

I fell in love with code as a kid when I got my first BASIC program to run. Then I spent [my career](https://linkedin.com/in/ginatrapani) writing software, writing about software, and leading software teams and companies.

These days, I make curiosities on the web, like [My Life in Weeks](https://weeks.ginatrapani.org), [Truisms](https://truisms.ginatrapani.org), and [more](/studio/). Find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ginatrapani.org) or send me an email to my usual username at Gmail.

Thanks for stopping by.
