# [Gina Trapani](/)

## Hello! I'm a software person who loves to make stuff.

I fell in love with code as a kid when I got my first BASIC program to run. Since then, I've spent my career writing software, writing about software, and leading software teams and companies.

I'm a former CEO, startup founder, and author. You can see my career path on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/ginatrapani), and some thoughts on life on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ginatrapani.org). Email me to my usual username at Gmail.

Thanks for stopping by.
